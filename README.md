Instructions:
This algorithm was implemented using jupyter notebook and it is a modified version of the [spatio-temporal-exploration](https://github.com/EarthByte/spatio-temporal-exploration) workflow generated by the [EarthByte Group](https://github.com/EarthByte) at The University of Sydney. 

These notebook are in the [python](https://github.com/geo-julian/spatiotemporal_exploration/tree/main/python) folder.

Within this, the following folders:

[input_data](https://github.com/geo-julian/spatiotemporal_exploration/tree/main/python/input_data) with the cleaned input data for porphyry Cu systems (positives) and barren volcanic rocks (negatives) for North America (NA) and South America (SA) to run the algorithms.

[case_AREPS](https://github.com/geo-julian/spatiotemporal_exploration/tree/main/python/case_AREPS) where all the data product of the analysis described in the __methodology__ is consigned.

[IoGAS_files](https://github.com/geo-julian/spatiotemporal_exploration/tree/main/python/IoGAS_files) where the .gas files used to create the histograms (all_data_iogas.gas) and the files used to create the reconstructed latitude vs. age of formation figures, using [IoGAs software](https://reflexnow.com/product/iogas/)
