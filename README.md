Instructions:
This code was implemented using Jupyter notebooks and it is a modified version of the [spatio-temporal-exploration](https://github.com/EarthByte/spatio-temporal-exploration) workflow generated by the [EarthByte Group](https://github.com/EarthByte) at The University of Sydney. 

The folder [python_All_data-NA_SA](https://github.com/geo-julian/spatiotemporal_exploration/tree/main/python_All_data-NA_SA) is including the code used to analyse the evolution of subduction zones and downgoing slab properties with the history of porphyry ore deposition across the Americas

The folder [python_NorthAmerica](https://github.com/geo-julian/spatiotemporal_exploration/tree/main/python_NorthAmerica) is including the code used to apply a wide range of prominent machine learning methods and show the results in terms of accuracy of predictions on the test dataset of North America.

The folder [python_SouthAmerica](https://github.com/geo-julian/spatiotemporal_exploration/tree/main/python_SouthAmerica) is including the code used to apply a wide range of prominent machine learning methods and show the results in terms of accuracy of predictions on the test dataset of South America.

## Supplementary Data

[IoGAS_files](https://github.com/geo-julian/spatiotemporal_exploration/tree/main/python/IoGAS_files) where the .gas files used to create the histograms (all_data_iogas.gas) and the files used to create the reconstructed latitude vs. age of formation figures, using [IoGAs software](https://reflexnow.com/product/iogas/) 

[ArcMap_files](https://github.com/geo-julian/spatiotemporal_exploration/tree/main/python/ArcMap_files) contains the packages (mpk extension) for all the prospectively maps for North America and South America.
