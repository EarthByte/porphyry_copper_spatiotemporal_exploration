## Instructions:
This code was implemented using Jupyter notebooks and it is a modified version of the [spatio-temporal-exploration](https://github.com/EarthByte/spatio-temporal-exploration) workflow generated by the [EarthByte Group](https://github.com/EarthByte) at The University of Sydney. 

The folder [python_All_data-NA_SA](https://github.com/geo-julian/spatiotemporal_exploration/tree/main/python_All_data-NA_SA) is including the code used to analyse the evolution of subduction zones and downgoing slab properties with the history of porphyry ore deposition across the Americas

The folder [python_NorthAmerica](https://github.com/geo-julian/spatiotemporal_exploration/tree/main/python_NorthAmerica) is including the code used to apply a wide range of prominent machine learning methods and show the results in terms of accuracy of predictions on the test dataset of North America.

The folder [python_SouthAmerica](https://github.com/geo-julian/spatiotemporal_exploration/tree/main/python_SouthAmerica) is including the code used to apply a wide range of prominent machine learning methods and show the results in terms of accuracy of predictions on the test dataset of South America.

## Gridded Input Data
The present location of these porphyry Cu systems and non-prospective rocks is connected with the tectonic properties presented in the convergence zone and the downgoing plate at the time these geological features were formed using the absolute plate motion global model and a new set of oceanic paleo-age grids developed in 1 million years intervals developed by [R. D. Müller et al. (2019)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018TC005462).


Additionally, this work also incorporates the time-dependent grids developed by [Dutkiewicz et al. (2018)](https://www.earthbyte.org/webdav/ftp/Data_Collections/Dutkiewicz_etal_2019_Geology/carbonate_sediment_thickness_grids/) which models the amount of carbonates present in deep-sea sediments since 170 Ma (there were no deep-sea carbonate sediments before this time) based on global carbonate compensation depth models, carbonate sedimentation rates and paleobathymetry. This work is also using the grids generated by [R. D. Müller and Dutkiewicz (2018)](https://www.earthbyte.org/webdav/ftp/Data_Collections/Muller_Dutkiewicz_2018_SciAdv/Supplementary_grids/oceanic_crustal_C02_grids/) which record the percentage of carbon storage in oceanic crust due degassing of CO2 in mid-ocean ridges since 230 Ma. Finally, it has also been incorporated here the grids from [Dutkiewicz et al. (2017)](https://www.earthbyte.org/webdav/ftp/Data_Collections/Dutkiewicz_etal_2017_G3/sediment_thickness_grids/) which models deep sea sediment thickness based on a regression algorithm using sea floor age, mean distance to nearest passive margins and long-term decompacted sedimentation. These three grids are based in the ocean crust paleo-age grid model generated by [R. D. Müller et al. (2016)](https://www.earthbyte.org/webdav/ftp/Data_Collections/Muller_Dutkiewicz_2018_SciAdv/Supplementary_grids/age_grids_AREPS2016/).
